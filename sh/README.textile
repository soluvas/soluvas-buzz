h1. Soluvas Buzz Shell

Considered shell technologies:

1. Groovy shell (used by Gremlin/Neo4j). Can use ad-hoc objects. Limited API completion. Seems to have SSH support or even AJAX web-based?
   Full programmability using Groovy syntax. No command help.
2. Scala shell (used by sbt). Can use ad-hoc objects. Good API completion. SSH support unknown, AJAX unknown. Not sure if it's embeddable,
   especially in non-Scala project. Full programmability using Scala syntax. No command help.
3. Blast Shell (fork of Karaf Console). Need to use specialized ExtCommandSupport Spring beans. Commands must be instantiable, otherwise
   one broken command will break the entire shell. SSH support working. Limited programmability but convenient. Commands can be composed (pipe).
   Nice command help support.
